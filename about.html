                <strong>I used to be a pack rat. </strong>I had so many things
                that I thought that I loved, but the truth was I couldn't even
                appreciate any of it because there was too much.<br /><br />Things
                were terrible. I had a job that I hated, a home that I didn't
                want to live in, and I couldn't hold a relationship.

                place and moved into a smaller apartment, and I quit my job.<br /><br />
                It wasn't easy at all, but everything around me was in such a
                bad place, I didn't know what else to do. And it worked.

                Now that I'm living a simple life, things are so much better.
